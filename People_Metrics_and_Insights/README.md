# 📘 People Metrics & Retention Insights 

**Project Type:** People Analytics / Employee Retention  
**Tools Used:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Faker  
**Final Output:** Markdown + PDF report

## 🔍 Project Summary

This project analyzes key employee metrics — including promotions, engagement, and department — to uncover hidden drivers of attrition. The goal is to support HR decision-making with data-driven insights and provide actionable recommendations to improve retention.

The final output is a written report generated from a Jupyter Notebook, combining EDA, predictive modeling, and strategic business advice based on the results.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset was generated synthetically using the **Faker** library, simulating a workforce of 5000 employees with fields such as:

- `EmployeeID`, `JoinDate`, `LastPromotionDate`, `LeftCompany`
- `Department`, `Location`, `JobLevel`, `Gender`
- `EngagementScore`, `PerformanceScore`, `ManagerSatisfaction`
- `TenureYears`, `NumTrainingsCompleted`, `AttritionReason`

## 📊 Key Analyses

### ✅ 1. Promotion Timing vs Attrition  
Explored whether delayed promotions impact employee retention.

### ✅ 2. Engagement vs Attrition  
Assessed if low engagement scores correlate with employees leaving.

### ✅ 3. Department-Level Attrition  
Identified high-risk departments with elevated attrition rates.

### ✅ 4. Predictive Modeling  
Used logistic regression to predict likelihood of employee attrition based on:
- Engagement
- Tenure
- Performance
- Promotion delay

Model performance was tracked with accuracy, recall, precision, F1-score.

## 💡 Final Recommendations

### 1. **Address Long-Term Promotion Stagnation**
- Focus on employees with 8+ years without promotion.
- Initiate proactive career pathing for mid-tenure staff.

### 2. **Look Beyond Engagement Surveys**
- Engagement scores alone don’t explain attrition.
- Conduct focused exit interviews to discover deeper retention factors.

### 3. **Department-Specific Strategies**
- Target **HR (32%)**, **Product (30%)**, and **Engineering (30%)** for retention support.
- Study **Sales (25%)** to uncover what’s working well.

### 4. **Build a Retention Risk Framework**
- Combine tenure, performance, and promotion data for early warning systems.
- Schedule quarterly reviews of at-risk talent cohorts.
