# 🧠 Employee Attrition Analysis & Prediction

This project aims to help HR professionals **predict and reduce employee attrition** using data-driven insights and machine learning models.

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

- Analyzed HR data to identify key drivers of attrition
- Built and compared classification models (Logistic Regression & Decision Tree)
- Predicted probability of attrition for each employee
- Exported a list of **high-risk employees** (`Attrition_Prob > 0.5`)
- Built an interactive dashboard to help HR understand who’s at risk and why

---

## 🧪 Technologies Used

- **Python**: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn  
- **Jupyter Notebook**: EDA, modeling, exporting data  
- **Power BI**: Dashboard and interactive filtering  
- **CSV**: Input and output datasets

## 📌 Key Takeaways

- Salary is not the only factor—OverTime and JobSatisfaction play critical roles  
- Some high-income employees still showed high attrition risk  
- Actionable recommendations (e.g., reduce workload, improve satisfaction)
