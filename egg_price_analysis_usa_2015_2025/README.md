# 🥚📈 Egg Price Analysis (2015–2025)

This project investigates the dramatic rise in U.S. egg prices between 2015 and 2025, comparing actual price trends with inflation-adjusted baselines using the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The goal is to uncover whether inflation alone explains the price spike—or if egg-specific market forces played a major role.

## ✍️ Summary Insight

> Between 2015 and 2021, egg prices remained stable even after inflation adjustment. But in 2022, prices surged dramatically—overshooting CPI-based expectations. The divergence points to external shocks in the egg industry, not just monetary inflation. Prices remain high even by 2025, signaling a possible long-term shift in supply dynamics.
