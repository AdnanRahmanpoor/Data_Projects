# CRM Data Quality Dashboard

## Project Description
An Excel-based business intelligence solution that monitors and analyzes CRM data quality in real-time. This dashboard helps organizations identify data integrity issues, reduce duplicate records, and maintain complete customer information to improve sales effectiveness and customer service. The tool provides actionable insights through interactive visualizations that highlight data quality issues requiring immediate attention.

## Dataset Explanation
The dashboard integrates with three key CRM datasets:
- **Company Data**: Records containing company profiles with attributes like industry, size, annual revenue, creation date, and last activity timestamp
- **Contact Data**: Individual contact records with personal information including names, job titles, email addresses, phone numbers, and activity metrics
- **Interaction Data**: Timestamped records of all customer interactions including type (call, email, meeting), outcome, and notes

## Excel Implementation
- **Data Processing**: Leveraged Excel Tables, PivotTables, and COUNTIFS/SUMPRODUCT formulas to analyze and transform raw CRM data into actionable insights
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Created dynamic charts (donut, column, gauge, pie) with conditional formatting to visually represent data quality metrics
- **User Controls**: Implemented slicers, data validation dropdowns, and parameter cells to enable user-defined filtering and customization
- **Drill-Down Capabilities**: Built hyperlinked navigation between summary metrics and detailed record analysis for efficient issue investigation
- **Automated Calculations**: Designed formulas to calculate duplicate detection scores, data completeness percentages, and account freshness metrics
